    "One specific mechanism leading to the persistence of poverty that has recently received a lot of\n",
    "attention operates through borrowing constraints.\n",
    "- Poor individuals face greater borrowing constraints, which prevent them from adopting efficient technologies or choosing profitable occupations, and hence they remain poor."

    "At the aggregate level, this implies that unlike in neoclassical growth models, two economies that are identical in terms of all parameters may end up with different levels of per capita incomes in the steady state if initially they have different distributions of wealth and hence different sizes of the types of credit constraints. \n",

    "- in the presence of credit market imperfections, the current distribution of wealth will determine the\n",
